# Starters for python projects

## Problem to solve

Common way to start python project without limitation from current OS Python (eg. hard to run even virtualenv for Python 3.7 in Ubuntu 16.04 as it supports up to Python 3.5).
The only things you need is Docker engine istalled. Make is nice to have but you can copy commands from Makefile.

## TL;DR

1. `git clone git@github.com:paterit/starter-selenium.git your_project_name`
1. `cd your_project_name`
1. `rm -rf .git`
1. `make build`
1. `git init`
1. `git add .`
1. `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
1. `subl starter.sublime-project`
